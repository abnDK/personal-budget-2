# 4. Database tools

The application contains a few handy tools for working backend with the database. The tools include the possibility to migrate the database up/down or resetting the database with the option to preserve the current data.

Database tools has to be run through menu.sh as references to other files in the db tools suite is based on a parent process run from the location of menu.sh (thus running i.e. ./reset_tables.sh from same folder should work fine)

References to filenames will be named with the personal_budget_2/src/utils folder. That is, if migration/upfiles is mentioned, the file will be located personal_budget_2/src/utils/migration/upfiles.
