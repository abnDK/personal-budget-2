## 4.2 Testing the database

Developing the database creates a need to populate the database with mock data from time to time. In the following section inserting test data etc. is discussed.

### 4.2.1 Insert test data

Inserting test data consist of several files, of which most is placed in the db_test folder. One other file - current_version - is placed in an adjecent folder migration. In db_test you'll find several .sql test data files (see 4.2.1.2) and the script insert_test_data.sh (see 4.2.1.1). In short, the script reads current_version and insert the corresponding test data, if available.

#### 4.2.1.1 Insert_test_data.sh
Script first reads the file migration/current_version
The expected .sql filename for holding corresponding test data is created - i.e. "test_data_<version-number>.sql"
We then look for that file in the same folder. If not found, an
error message will be printed to the console.
If found, the filename will be run as a file argument with the psql command.
Every line written to the database will be printed to the commandline as well.



#### 4.2.1.2 Test_data_x-x.sql
Files consist of a .sql query inserting testdata.
Testdata is written in a format corresponding to the datamodel / tables in database of the same version as the file states.
